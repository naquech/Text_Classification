    "<p>The data set for this project is sourced from Figure Eight platform and the name of the set is Sentiment Analysis on Global Warming/Climate Change. The set contains three classifications: Yes if the tweet suggests global warming existence, No if the tweet is in disagreement, and neutral if the tweet is not engaged on either side. A column with the confidence score for the classification of each tweet is included in the set with a total of 6090 rows.</p>\n",

    "* Tokenize data: split a string of text into individual tokens (words)\n",
    "* Remove suffixes using stemming technique\n",
